I am a detail-oriented Data Analyst and Research Specialist with a passion for transforming complex data into actionable insights. I have a strong background in data management, statistical analysis, and research support, and I excel at communicating research results to diverse stakeholdersâ€”including sports organizations. I specialize in managing intricate datasets and building robust R-based pipelines for data import, cleaning, and analysis, with comprehensive documentation in Quarto/R Markdown to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Whether handling ad hoc requests or tackling text mining tasks for ongoing projects, I deliver timely, accurate results that drive collaborative, data-driven decision making.
